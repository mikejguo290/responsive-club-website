    <!-- this is to mock up a long scrolling homepage for Curve instead of the concise 'about' page we currently 
    land on. 
    I have removed indoor section as curve doesn't do indoor. 
    moved Covid back
    Going to try and move calendar to a widget on the homepage 
    I like the "training this week" widget in the current site. -->
